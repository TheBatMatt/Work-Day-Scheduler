## Work Day Planner

You ever realize that you're having trouble making every hour of your day count? Need something to better itemize your time? Well, good thing I made this Work Day Planner then! Every typcial work day hour, complete with colors coded for past, present and future, to help you better keep track of current needed tasks! 

Royal Blue represents future hours.
Red represents the current hour.
Gray represents past hours.

The planner is currently structured on a typcai 9-5 work shift. If I decide to go back this this in the future, I may make it into a 12 hour 6am-6pm planner.
